PyCitySchools Written Report

1) One observation I noticed is that the students in the smaller schools seem to have a larger 
   average score in both reading and math. The smaller schools also have more students
   passing both math and reading then the large schools.


2) Another thing I noticed is that the average grades in math were on average lower than the grades
   in reading. So no matter what grade or school you go to math seems to be harder for the students 
   than reading.
